# Miscellaneous Proxy for [ytdl-patched](https://github.com/nao20010128nao/ytdl-patched)

This is a proxy for ytdl-patched for some websites.

This is mostly used for proxying HLS requests for [Mildom](https://www.mildom.com/), which requires special treatment on playlist and segment requests.

# Use it now
Get [ytdl-patched here](https://github.com/nao20010128nao/ytdl-patched), pass Mildom live URL (e.g. https://www.mildom.com/42), then all HLS requests go through this proxy.
